Jan K.C., a little "kidult" followed her early education in Asia with further education in the UK where she majored in fashion designs.

Whilst part of London’s multi-cultural environments, Jan absorbed everything: dotes, lines, colours with textures – plus a huge amount of chocolate.

Inspired by early Japanese KaWaii street art, Jan then adds a little bit of natural-born persistence and perfectionism to her own work. Everything she sees with her eyes is instantly and succinctly fermented in her mind and into her designs.

Her work is sometimes described as unconventional yet beautiful.
