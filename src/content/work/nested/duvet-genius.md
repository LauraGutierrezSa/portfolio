Controls Overview
Left Arrow Key: Move Doodle to the left.
Right Arrow Key: Move Doodle to the right.
Tab Key: Jump!

Avoid Falling: If Doodle misses a platform and falls off the bottom of the screen, the game is over. Keep Doodle jumping from platform to platform to avoid this.

Tips for Success
Stay Centered: Keep Doodle near the center of the screen to give yourself more time to react to upcoming platforms.
Use Arrow Keys Wisely: Tap the arrow keys lightly for small movements or hold them down for bigger shifts. Quick reflexes are key!
Avoid Obstacles: Be on the lookout for monsters, broken platforms, and other hazards. Move Doodle away from these dangers using the arrow keys.
